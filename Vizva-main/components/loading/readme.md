```jsx
import Loading from "components/loading";
```

```jsx
<Loading
  title="Loading"
  message="the operation you are performing isnt a valid one"
  isOpen={true}
/>
```

- **title**: this is the title to be given defaults to loading
- **message**: a short description
- **isOpen**: is is open or not

## if you want the Loading component to call a function after loading please reach out to me and i will implement that feature
